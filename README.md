# Dendritic Attention System with WaveNeurons

A system that combines audio synthesis with an adaptive dendritic attention mechanism that naturally forms fractal patterns.

# Quick Start

Clone the code

Install requirements

Run it: 

python coolshitx3.py

# What it Does

This system generates sound through WaveNeurons while simultaneously visualizing how a dendritic attention system processes and
learns from the 3D phase space of these waves. The attention system naturally forms fractal-like patterns as it learns, regardless
of the input type. You can also try different input types to explore the fractals it creates. 

# Key components:

WaveNeurons: Generate audio waveforms (sine, square, saw, triangle, noise)

Dendritic Attention: Observes patterns and grows dendrites based on activity gradients

Adaptive Focus: An "iris effect" that expands/contracts based on pattern recognition

Fractal Formation: The system naturally organizes into fractal structures

# Understanding What You See

The main visualization shows the attention field with:

Red channel: The system's "expected pattern" (forms fractal structures)
Green channel: Active dendrites growing toward interesting patterns
Blue channel: Attention focus field (iris effect)

The fractal patterns emerge from the system's own processing mechanisms, not from the input itself - representing how the system organizes and makes sense of information.
